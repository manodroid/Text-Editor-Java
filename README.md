## ðŸ¤” Purpose
This project was created to demonstrate some of the topics covered in the Java course *(OOP, Exceptions and Assertions, Searching Algorithms, GUI and Event Driven Programming, Files and Text Manipulation)*. Beside that, we wanted to create something special and more challenging.

The Notepad editor on Windows served as our inspiration for this project. It began as a simple panel with only two functions, however it gradually improved and began to resemble a real text editor. We decided to include some features that were similar to those found in the Windows Notepad version, as well as some new ones that we thought would be cool and useful. :smile:
