# Text-Editor-Java
This was our final project for the Java class. It started as a simple panel with only two functions, but slowly it got better and started to 
look like notepad and other text editors.
Through it we managed to improve in Java and also learn the Swing library for making the whole GUI.
In the file tab the user can manipulate dhe working file, it can save it or rename it and the file state will be updated immediatly.
At tools he can change the text of the file with the functions copy,paste,cut and select all. To make it easier for the user we also included
find and replace wich will find a file and highlight it or replace an word with another. All this using regular expressions.
Themes provides the user with options for making the text editor more appealing or easier to use by changing the font, its size and the theme.
