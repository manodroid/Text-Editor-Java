## ðŸ¤” Purpose
This project was created to demonstrate some of the topics covered in the Java course *(OOP, Exceptions and Assertions, Searching Algorithms, GUI and Event Driven Programming, Files and Text Manipulation)*. Beside that, we wanted to create something special and more challenging.

The Notepad editor on Windows served as our inspiration for this project. It began as a simple panel with only two functions, however it gradually improved and began to resemble a real text editor. We decided to include some features that were similar to those found in the Windows Notepad version, as well as some new ones that we thought would be cool and useful. :smile:

## âœ¨ Features
The following are some of the features we included in this project:

- Files Tab
    - New
    - Open
    - Save
    - Rename
    - Exit
- Tools Tab
    - Replace
    - Find
    - Select All
    - Copy
    - Paste
    - Cut
    - Spell Check
- View Tab
    - Increase Font Size
    - Decrease Font Size
    - Dark Mode
    - Font
- Help Tab
    - Shortcuts
    - About

In the last commit another tool was added, now the user can check if he has misspelled any word during writing. The whole text is analyzed and the wrong
words are highlighter in red. Then it is taken a step further because the user can right-click the highlighted text and then select a correction for the
word. This way the correction can be more accurate and with fewer keystrokes.
